## Commands

### `/library_stats`
View statistics about your Suwayomi library.

**Displays:**
- Total manga in library
- Total chapters
- Unread chapters
- Downloaded chapters
- Categories and sources

---

### `/request_manga`
Search for manga across all available sources.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required) - Search term (e.g., "One Piece")
- `limit` (optional) - Results per source (1-10, default: 5)
- `include_nsfw` (optional) - Include NSFW sources (default: false)

**Features:**

---

### `/downloads`
Show current download queue status.

**Displays:**

## Configuration

### Log Levels

Set `LOG_LEVEL` in your `.env` file:

- `DEBUG` - Verbose logging for development
- `INFO` - Standard operational logging (recommended)
- `WARNING` - Only warnings and errors
- `ERROR` - Only error messages

### Guild ID (Optional)

Setting `GUILD_ID` makes commands sync instantly to your specific server. Without it, commands sync globally (takes up to 1 hour).

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't connect to Suwayomi

**Check:**
1. Suwayomi-Server is running (`http://localhost:4567` should be accessible)
2. API key is correct in `.env`
3. URL doesn't have trailing slash or quotes
4. Firewall allows connection

**Test connection:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" http://localhost:4567/api/graphql
```

### Commands don't appear in Discord

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure bot has `applications.commands` scope
2. Wait up to 1 hour for global command sync, or set `GUILD_ID` for instant testing
3. Check bot permissions in your server
4. Restart Discord client

### Search returns no results

**Check:**
1. Extensions are installed in Suwayomi
2. Sources are not down
3. Try broader search terms
4. Enable NSFW if searching for mature content

### Images not showing

**Possible causes:**
1. Discord embed permissions
2. Suwayomi server not accessible from internet (if bot is hosted remotely)
3. Source image URLs expired

## Rich Presence

The bot automatically updates its status every hour to show:

```
Playing librarian with X,XXX chapters
```

Where X,XXX is the total number of downloaded chapters in your library.

## Rate Limiting & Performance

- Search queries are throttled (0.3s delay between sources)
- Download batches process 50 chapters at a time
- Session keepalive with connection pooling
- Automatic retry logic for failed requests

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

### Development Setup

1. Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for verbose logging
2. Use `GUILD_ID` for instant command testing
3. Test against a non-production Suwayomi instance
